    <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
    <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore, who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
    <p>Nelson Mandela is considered a hero for his lifelong dedication to fighting against apartheid in South Africa. He endured imprisonment for 27 years, advocating for equality and justice. Mandela's efforts led to the end of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic South Africa, making him an iconic symbol of resilience, forgiveness, and positive change.</p>
